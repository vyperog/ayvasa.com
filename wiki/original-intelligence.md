## Definition

Original Intelligence (OI) is the non-narrative, innate intelligence that remains when interference and conditioning settle. It is not something acquired or cultivated, but something revealed as unnecessary activity falls away.

## In Ayvasa

Within Ayvasa, OI is not a belief, identity, or metaphysical claim. It refers to a repeatable shift in how experience organizes itself: less central narration, more direct functioning. Action arises without internal debate, and perception is no longer filtered through constant self-reference. OI operates prior to the felt split between “me” and “world.”

## How it shows up

- Decisions land cleanly, without prolonged analysis
- Inner friction and resistance decrease
- Action feels quieter, simpler, and more effective
- A sense of being *moved* rather than *managing*
- Less concern with self-monitoring or justification

## What it is not

- A special state to maintain
- A personal identity (“I am OI”)
- Emotional numbness or detachment
- Loss of functionality or agency
